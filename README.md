# Zshoes_Case-Study

## Objective:

Predicting shoes price for the customers of Zshoes and deploy with the help of flask.

## Problem Statement:

Zshoes.com is one of the famous shoe manufacturers of India and has business in
almost every country in Asia and Europe. They are one of the best choices of all the
athletics and they make the best shoes for running. Due to pandemic, they are facing a
loss as Zshoes are a bit expensive. They want to know the correct price of all types of
shoes that they are manufacturing so that they wonâ€™t face any loss and at the same
time customers also buy the shoes. As a machine learning engineer, we have to build a
shoe-price prediction app that can predict the correct shoe price by taking inputs like
freight_value,payment_type, etc.
